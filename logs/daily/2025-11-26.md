## Today's Goal
> Scale up to larger dataset (~256 hours) with MusicGen delay pattern validated from delay ablation

## Experiments

### EXP: `20251126_dia_006_musicgen_delay_larger_dataset`
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress  
**W&B:** https://wandb.ai/ocamp-university-of-michigan/dia-music-finetuning/runs/l2fzeu4u  
**Hypothesis:** Will get good results with musicgen delay pattern on larger dataset. Good test to see quality it can do with new delay through balancing bass + drums + melody.

**Setup:**
- ~84k samples (~80% tagged)
- 256 hour dataset
- MusicGen delay pattern (validated from dia_004/005 ablation)
- Smaller architecture to account for dataset size
- Sliding window active (though most audio is short anyway)

**Results:**
*(in progress)*

## Previous Findings Summary (from delay ablation)

### `20251125_dia_004_delay_ablation`
**Result:** MusicGen delay pattern wins ✅

| Metric | MusicGen (NEW) | Dia (OLD) | Winner |
|--------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Train loss @ ~22k steps | 4.24 | 4.41 | NEW (~4% lower) |
| Output entropy | 4.45 | 4.65 | NEW (more confident) |
| Eval loss | 7.91 | 7.72 | OLD (but NEW overfitting harder = expected) |
| Variance | smoother | noisier | NEW |
| Audio quality | smoother, cleaner melody | - | NEW |

**Theory:** Closer together is better. Waiting too long to generate subsequent tokens is not good. Larger gaps force model to reconstruct from distant sequence positions degrading coherence - relevant context is further away, making it harder for model to remember.

### `20251125_dia_005_delay_compressed`
**Result:** Worse than both - cut early

**Theory:** Sequential ordering matters. Closer != better - the unique sequential delay per codebook matters more than just minimizing max delay. Having too far proximity hurts, but so does too close proximity. Balance is just sequential proximity.

**Conclusion:** MusicGen delay pattern is the way to go for foreseeable future.

## Key Insights
- MusicGen-style delay (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) outperforms original Dia pattern (0,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) for melody-focused data
- Equal codebook weighting benefits high-frequency content (aligns with MusicGen paper findings)
- Sequential proximity matters - not too far, not too close

## Blockers / Questions
- Not sure how much sliding window matters when most audio is short anyway

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Monitor dia_006 results
- Potentially increase dataset if needed
